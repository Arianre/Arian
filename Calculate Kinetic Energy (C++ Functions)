/*
Write a function named kineticEnergy that accepts an object's mass (in kg)
and velocity (in m/s) as arguments. 
The function should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has.
Demonstrate the function by calling it in a program that asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.

KE = 1/2 * m * v(to the power of 2)
