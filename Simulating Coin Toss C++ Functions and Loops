/*
Write a function named coinToss that simulates the tossing of a coin.
When you call the function, it should generate a random number in the range of 1 through 2.
If the random number is 1, the function should display "heads", if it is 2, it should display "tails".
Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user how many times the coin should be tossed,
and then simulates the tossing of the coin that number of times.
