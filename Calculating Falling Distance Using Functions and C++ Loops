/* 
Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an object's falling time (in seconds) as an argument.
The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments, and displays the return value.

Formula:  d = 1/2 * g * t(to the power of 2)
