/*Create a change-counting game that gets the user to enter the number of coins 
required to make exactly one dollar. The program should ask the user to enter 
the number of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. If the total value of the 
coins entered is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user
for winning the game. Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating
whether the amount entered was more than or less than one dollar.*/
